# CloudFront Environment Variables Setup

Add the following environment variables to your .env file:

```
# CloudFront Configuration
CLOUDFRONT_DOMAIN=d3kpn8l37jcfni.cloudfront.net
CLOUDFRONT_KEY_PAIR_ID=E2GCW89YXXH3SR
# The CloudFront private key must be properly formatted with \n for line breaks
CLOUDFRONT_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nMIIEvQIBADANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAASCBKcwggSjAgEAAoIBAQCWP1MPNuz5dST...rest of your private key...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----"
```

Instructions:

1. The Key-Pair-ID (E2GCW89YXXH3SR) looks correct - this is what AWS assigned when the CloudFront key pair was created.

2. For the CLOUDFRONT_PRIVATE_KEY:
   - You need to use the private key that corresponds to the key pair ID E2GCW89YXXH3SR
   - This is the .pem file that was downloaded when the key pair was created in AWS
   - Make sure it has proper line breaks with \n characters
   - It must begin with "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n" and end with "\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----"

3. Make sure there are no spaces before or after the = sign in your .env file

4. Restart your application after adding these variables
